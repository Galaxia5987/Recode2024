# Autonomous Specifications
## Linked waypoints
- `Lower position`: Lower starting position
- `Intake line start`
- `Intake line end`
## Paths
- `Intaking zone to high position`
  - Drive from the intaking zone, pick up a cone, wait for a second, and drive close to the second alliance's loading zone.

  - Special constraints (if relevant)
    - Near loading zone: decrease speed so the red dragon won't notice us.

- Another one...
## Autos
- `Intaking zone to high position while shooting`
  - Uses `Intaking zone to high position` path
  - Shoots after passing the second waypoint, near the Charge Station

# Choosers
> Could be as simple as "Using PathPlanner's built-in chooser" (BTW use [this](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/pathplanner-2024-beta/442364/149?u=dan)) or more complex based on the game, like what's been done [here](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/frc-6328-mechanical-advantage-2023-build-thread/420691/179#autos-the-questionnaire-2):
## Side chooser
Choose which side the robot's on:
- Left
- Center
- Right
## Game piece chooser
Choose which game piece type the robot is preloaded with:
- Cube
- Cone
## State machine
> Mermaid state graph which shows which auto to run based on the chooser goes here.

# Dashboard
> Include here fields that will be sent over NetworkTables and shown to the drivers during the autonomous period of the match.
- Robot location: `Robot/Odometry`
- Time left until teleop starts: `Robot/TimeLeftUntilTeleop`
